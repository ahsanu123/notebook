= Plan

this machine is splited into 3 main part, move mechanism, filler pump (with peristaltic pump),
and cup-dispenser

the basic idea is, use cup dispenser to emit cup, then use move mechanism to move cup forward into peristaltic pump sauce, then use additional mechanism (which i dont know right now) to close cup.
